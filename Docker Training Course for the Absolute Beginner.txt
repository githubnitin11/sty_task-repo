Docker Training Course for the Absolute Beginner 

what is container..??

docker container is like virtual m/c they have same processer, network, mounts but they can share same OS.
2 types of docker edition 
community, enterpsice addition.
community is free 

to check docker version 
docker -v

Docker service services 
service docker status 
service docker start
service docker status

To check list of  docker images 
docker images

To check no. of  docker container
docker ps 

To check all docker container
docker ps -a   

To create and run docker container from image 
docker run -it ubuntu <-- image name 

why we use -it <--- because when container creation process complite then we will enter in that container 

why we use -d <--- it is detached mode it run container in background 

To come out from docker container (but all process in container will be stop)
exit

To come out from docker container (but all process in container will not stop)
contol+p+q 

To delete the image 
docker rmi image name 

To remove all the images in one time 
docker image prune -a

To remove all the images in one time 
docker container prune 

To stop the docker container 
docker stop cantainer name 

To remove the docker container
docker remove container name 

To pull docker docker image from hub
docker pull image name 

To get PTD,UTD
docker top container id 

TO go in container 
docker exec -it container id/name  /bin/bash

To launch a container for prticuler time and after that it shoud me delete we use 
docker run -it --name nginx3 nginx sleep 20

To see the containt of /etc/hosts file of that container 
docker exec -it container id/name cat /etc/hosts

To run the container in detaech mode and come quick on interface 
 docker run -d --name container4 imagename 

To check the details of container its version. go in docker container and use 
 cat /etc/*release*


Run docker container using redis cmd 
docker run redis

To remove all the images in one time 
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)

Docker Tag
docker tag used to pull a spesific version of image otherwise it will pull only letest (by default)
EX-docker pull refis:4.0 

Default database listening port is 3306 

Port mapping 
docker run -p server port on that we expose our app:container internal port  container name 
ex - docker run -p 80:5000 webapp 

Database are stored in /var/lib/mysql location (by default)
now to store the data on docker host we use 
#docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql ( here mysql is your container )


When you want to find the data of container in deatils format ,id,network,ip add, settings,state,mount 
#docker inspect containername 

why we use /bin/bash
So, for the specific case of the Ubuntu image, docker run ... ubuntu /bin/bash is no different from docker run ... ubuntu.

to se the laos of container we use 
docker logs container name 
-------------------------------------------------
to install jenkins on docker use 
docker run -it --name jenkins-conatiner -p 8080:8080 -v /root/my-jenkins-data:var/jrnkins/jenkins_home -u root jenkins

-----------------------------------------------
Docker images





-----------------------------------------------------
Environment veriable 

used to change when we want to change in again and agin or when we requed 
ex - colure fo app export APP_COLOUR=blue; python app.py

to change ENV. VERIALBLE use -e 

docker run -e APP_COLOR=pink simple-webapp-color 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Docker compose 
docker compose is generally use when we have many of dependancy in project so we can use docker compose.
in .yml file we will define our all services/container and in jsut single command all aplication can be up 

#docker-compose up 

for tha 1st you have to create docker image for all services then create a container  and link each other 
 *1st you need to install docker compose file 
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
*give permission 
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
*check the version of docker compose file 
docker-compose --version

** for docker compose3 not need to use link section it will automatically connect ech other 

--------------------------------------------------
Docker engineen 
. /usr/share/nginx/html/test 

docker run --name fruit-list -d -p 8080:80 fruit-list:1.0.0



Of course, this needn't be true always. A Dockerfile for a database engine may run the database command by default. In that case, if you needed an interactive shell, you'll need to do docker run ... /bin/bash.

In general, you can't assume that docker run will give you an interactive shell. It's safer to specify /bin/bash if you need a shell.
